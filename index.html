<hr>
<p>Raicoin will be developed based on the ideas of NANO(formerly Raiblocks) but with many different and new features.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Node Reward</strong>: all nodes with election weight can earn reward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Credit Mechanism</strong>: NANO uses POW to anti transaction flooding attack, this approach will be replaced by the new credit system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Accounts destroy little amount coin to get credits from the network, than allowed to do (20 x credits) transactions every day(In a word, buy once for life).</li>
<li>Any account must have at least 1 credit when it is created.</li>
<li>The cost of credit will gradually decrease.</li>
<li>Transactions from accounts with high remaining percentage of allowed transactions will be processed first when the network is busy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Achievable and Sustainable high performance</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Two types of nodes are designed: light node and full node. light nodes can not only do pruning but also unpruning when needed.</li>
<li>light nodes are designed to run on ramdisk/NVMe/SSD as election nodes, and full nodes run on HDD as backup nodes.</li>
<li>Rough IO performance on different device: 10k+ txs/s (ramdisk), 2k+ txs/s (NVMe), 1k txs/s(SSD), hundreds txs/s(HDD).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bandwidth Saving</strong>: election on block will be changed to election on fork, save up to 90% bandwidth cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Custom Data Field</strong>: the protocol will add a custom variable-length data field. This field can be used to take extra infomation(e.g. transaction notes, order number, user id).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Privacy</strong>: mixer addon can be developed based on the custom data field. Third party will be happy to develop and run a mixer to get more users and more node reward. An offical implementation may also be developed if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Distribution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All coins are generated by node reward.</li>
<li>New generated coins of each year:<br>
1st year: 40M,<br>
2nd year: 30M,<br>
3rd year: 20M,<br>
4th year: 10M,
from 5th year: about 5% coins.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Airdrop</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Airdrop is randomly distributed based on the total online time of the node, that is, the higher online time, the higher probability of getting airdrop.</li>
<li>Airdrop will last 4 years, the approximate amounts by time:<br>
1st quarter of 1st year: 7M,<br>
2nd quarter of 1st year: 4M,<br>
3rd quarter of 1st year: 3M,<br>
4th quarter of 1st year: 2M,<br>
2nd year: 5M,<br>
3rd year: 2M,<br>
4th year: 1M.</li>
<li>To anti sybil attack, in first 2 quarters, only invited nodes can get airdrop. And after then all nodes can get airdrop.</li>
<li>How to get invitations?
<ul>
<li>To be active github contributors for the project.</li>
